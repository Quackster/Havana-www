## Havana-www
This repository contains the frontend web assets (gamedata) for [Havana](https://github.com/Quackster/Havana/), private Habbo Hotel server software.

These files are intended to be served to clients connecting to a Havana server.

## Purpose
Havana-www provides:

* Furnidata
* Product data
* Figure data
* Furniture files for both Shockwave and Flash
* Client files

This repository mirrors the behavior of the traditional gamedata or web build hosting used by Habbo Hotel, and is essential for running a fully functional Havana server environment.

## Download

You can download the latest gamedata package from the [Releases](https://github.com/Quackster/Havana-www/releases) page.

Each release contains a .zip archive of the current version, ready to be hosted on your own web server.

## Contributing

This repository is mostly static and updated to match the expected format for Havana. Pull requests to fix or update gamedata files (e.g. from newer releases or to improve compatibility) are welcome.

## License
This project is provided for educational and development purposes. Refer to the main Havana repository for overall licensing and contribution guidelines.
